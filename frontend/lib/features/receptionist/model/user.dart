/* Purpose (Moto) of the File:
 This file defines the `User` model class, which represents a user in the app.
 It is used to structure and manage user-related data such as name, email,
 password, address, user type (e.g., admin, customer), and an authentication token.

 The class includes:
 - A constructor to create User instances
 - Serialization methods (toMap, fromMap, toJson, fromJson) for converting
   User objects to and from Map/JSON formats
 - A `copyWith` method to easily create modified copies of a User instance

 This model is typically used to parse user data received from a backend (e.g., API),
 save user data locally, or send data back to a server.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

/*It acts as a data model to store, transfer, and manipulate user  information efficiently.

The toMap() and fromMap() methods are used for data serialization and deserialization.

toMap(): Converts a Player object into a Map (key-value pairs).

fromMap(): Converts a Map (received from a database, API, or Socket.IO) back into a Player object.*/
